This was a homework assignment for High Performance Computing where I practiced operator overloading in C++.

It wasn't too advanced as far was what I've practiced, but it was good practice with OOP in C++. Point.h and Point.cpp are both written by my professor, Dr. Rao. Otherwise, aside from some template methods to get me started, this was all written myself.
